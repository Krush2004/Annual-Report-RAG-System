# 📘 Annual Report RAG – AI Q&A System

A **production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that enables users to ask natural language questions about an **Annual Report PDF** and receive **accurate, evidence-backed answers strictly grounded in the document**.

The system is designed to **avoid hallucinations**, provide **page-level citations**, show **highlighted supporting evidence**, and display **confidence scores** that reflect the strength of the retrieved information.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Annual reports are lengthy and complex, making it difficult to quickly extract precise information.  
The objective of this project is to build an AI system that:

- Answers questions **only using the uploaded PDF**
- Prevents hallucinated or assumed information
- Clearly communicates **what is known, partially known, or not available**
- Provides **transparent citations and confidence indicators**
- Handles ambiguous and missing-information queries safely

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

This application implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline where:

1. The PDF is loaded and split into meaningful text chunks  
2. Each chunk is enriched with **section-level metadata**  
3. Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings  
4. Embeddings are stored in a **Pinecone Vector Database**  
5. Relevant chunks are retrieved using **semantic similarity and section-aware logic**  
6. An LLM generates answers **strictly from the retrieved context**  
7. The UI presents:
   - Final answer
   - Confidence score
   - Page-level citations
   - Highlighted supporting evidence
